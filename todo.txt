[v0.1] node cut.js -d ',' -f 2 tmp1.txt

----->Environment<-----

✅ -> create folders :- src , test, appTest 
✅ -> create files :- cut.js, lib.js, testLib.js 
✅ -> make connections :-
        to main file and lib.js
        to test file and src file
✅ -> make sure that mocha runs
✅ -> make sure nyc runs 
✅ -> make sure npm package file is proper
✅ -> make sure git ignore should be proper
✅ -> npm test
    
----->Required Tasks<------

-> node cut.js -d ',' -f 2 tmp1.txt
✅ -> parseUserOptions
✅ -> readFileContents
✅ -> getFieldsList
✅ -> getRequiredFields 
✅ -> main  

---->Bugs<-----

✅ -> if any line contain only one field the whole line should be given for any field required
✅ -> error flow didn't considered
✅ -> in -f field instead of number if given a character error should popup
        expected : cut: [-cf] list: illegal list value
✅ -> in -f field if given zero error should popup
        expected : cut: [-cf] list: values may not include zero
✅ -> if the -f given is greater than no of fields in a line the output for that line should be empty

----->changes needed<-----

✅ -> fields - rows
✅ -> getFields - cutFields
✅ -> don't export function just for test
